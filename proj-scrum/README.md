# Lab Activity: Exploring Scrum Through Website Reverse Engineering

### Objective:

To gain a practical understanding of Scrum principles by reverse engineering a website and applying Scrum concepts to prototype development.

### Prerequisite:
- Scrum:
  - https://youtu.be/9TycLR0TqFA
  - https://youtu.be/SWDhGSZNF9M
- Figma: https://youtu.be/FTFaQWZBqQ8

### Instructions:

1. **Website Exploration:**
   Please visit the website https://www.proshopdemo.dev/ to familiarize yourself with its functionalities.

2. **Reverse Engineering:**
   Instead of starting with user stories, you will deduce user stories after exploring the website. For instance, consider actions like registration and login.

3. **Team Formation:**
   Work in groups and form a Scrum team. Each group member should choose one of the roles in Scrum.

4. **Understanding the Roles:**
   Discuss the role of the Product Owner within Scrum. What does a Product Owner do?

5. **Scrum Master's Necessity:**
   Consider whether having a Scrum Master is required for this scenario.

6. **Creating User Stories:**
   Collaborate to build the product backlog and define user stories. Use the format: "As a ... , I need ..., so that ..."

7. **Sprint Overview:**
   This course will involve 4 sprints:
   - Sprint 1: Create a prototype using `Figma` or `Draw.io`.
   - Sprint 2: Develop a full stack app **without** authentication or user registration.
   - Sprint 3: Implement a full stack app **with** authentication **AND** user registration.
   - Sprint 4: Add testing and finish the app.

8. **Current Focus:**
   For this lab activity, your focus will be on the first sprint: prototyping.

9. **Sprint Backlog:**
   Develop a sprint backlog by breaking user stories into tasks required for the prototype development.

10. **Understanding Burndown Chart:**
    Discuss the meaning and significance of a burndown chart in the context of Scrum.

11. **Ceremonies Exploration:**
    Discuss the three key Scrum ceremonies: sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review.

12. **Backlog Clarification:**
    Discuss the distinction between the product backlog and the sprint backlog.

13. **Presentation Preparation (Outside Class, In Groups):**
   - Make sure your team is prepared to share your experience and findings.
   - One or two groups will be selected at random to make a short presentation during the next class.

14. **Presentation and Discussion (Next Week, In-Class):**
   - Chosen groups present their experience, challenges, and insights.
   - Discuss how you applied Scrum concepts, overcame obstacles, and managed prototype development.

### Assessment:
Your understanding of Scrum principles will be assessed through participation, prototype quality, comprehension of Scrum concepts, and presentation skills.

### Recap
This lab activity provides you with a hands-on experience to understand Scrum in action. Work together, apply what you've learned, and be ready to share your insights during the presentation next week.

Finally, remember that this lab activity serves as a starting point for your upcoming project. It's designed to give you a head start.
