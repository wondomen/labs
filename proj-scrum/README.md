# Lab: Introduction to Scrum for Beginners

In this lab, you'll be introduced to the fundamental concepts of Scrum, a widely-used agile framework for managing and delivering projects. Scrum promotes collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development. Let's dive in!

**Step 1: Understanding Scrum Basics**

1. **Introduction to Scrum:**
   Read a brief introduction about Scrum. Watch a video or read an article that explains what Scrum is, its benefits, and its core principles.

2. **Scrum Roles:**
   Familiarize yourself with the three primary roles in Scrum:
   - Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team work effectively.
   - Product Owner: Represents the customer and defines the project's requirements.
   - Development Team: Creates the product in iterations.

3. **Scrum Artifacts:**
   Learn about the key artifacts in Scrum:
   - Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features and requirements.
   - Sprint Backlog: The tasks the team commits to completing during a sprint.
   - Increment: The sum of all completed items in a sprint.

**Step 2: Creating a Simple Scrum Board**

1. **Set Up Your Board:**
   Create a physical or digital Scrum board. Use sticky notes (or a tool like Trello) to simulate a Scrum board.

2. **Define User Stories:**
   Write down a few simple user stories on sticky notes, such as "As a user, I want to create an account."

3. **Prioritize Stories:**
   Arrange the user stories on your board in order of priority, placing the most important ones at the top.

**Step 3: Running a Mock Scrum Sprint**

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   Select the top user stories from your backlog and move them to the "Sprint Backlog" section of your board.

2. **Daily Standup (Daily Scrum):**
   Imagine that you're the development team. In your own words, share what you did yesterday, what you're planning to do today, and if you have any obstacles.

3. **Working on Tasks:**
   Over the course of a few days, work on the user stories you committed to during the sprint planning. Move sticky notes to reflect progress.

4. **Sprint Review:**
   At the end of the sprint, review what you've accomplished. Move completed user stories to the "Increment" section.

**Step 4: Reflecting and Improving**

1. **Sprint Retrospective:**
   Reflect on the sprint. Discuss what went well, what could be improved, and what changes you want to implement in the next sprint.

2. **Adapt and Repeat:**
   Based on the retrospective, adjust your approach for the next sprint. Repeat the process with a new set of user stories.

**Summary:**

In this lab, you gained an introductory understanding of Scrum by creating a simple Scrum board, running a mock sprint, and reflecting on the process. Scrum's iterative and collaborative approach allows teams to deliver value incrementally and adapt to changing requirements. This lab serves as a starting point for your journey into the world of Scrum and agile project management.
