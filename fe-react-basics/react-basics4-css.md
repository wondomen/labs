# Lab: Exploring Props and Styling in a React Project

In this lab, you'll create a React component, pass props to it, and console.log() the properties. You'll also gain an understanding of props as objects, use JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces, and apply CSS styles to your component.

**Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment**

1. **Create a New React App:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```
   npx create-react-app react-props-styling-lab
   cd react-props-styling-lab
   ```

**Step 2: Creating and Using a Component with Props**

1. **Create a New Component:**
   Open the `src` folder in your project directory. Inside the `src` folder, create a new file named `Greeting.js`.

2. **Write the Component:**
   Open `Greeting.js` and write the following code:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function Greeting(props) {
       console.log(props); // Log the props object
       
       return (
           <div className="greeting">
               <h1>Welcome, {props.name}!</h1>
               <p>{props.message}</p>
           </div>
       );
   }

   export default Greeting;
   ```

**Step 3: Using the Component and Passing Props**

1. **Open `src/App.js`:**
   Open the `src/App.js` file and replace the existing code with the following:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import Greeting from './Greeting';
   import './App.css'; // Import CSS file

   function App() {
       return (
           <div className="App">
               <Greeting name="Alice" message="Welcome to the lab!" />
           </div>
       );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

**Step 4: Console Logging Props and Styling with CSS**

1. **Open `src/App.css`:**
   Create a new file named `App.css` in the `src` folder and write some CSS rules:

   ```css
   .greeting {
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
       padding: 20px;
       border: 1px solid #ddd;
       text-align: center;
   }
   ```

**Step 5: Run the App**

1. **Start the App:**
   Save all your changes and return to the terminal. Make sure you're still in the `react-props-styling-lab` directory. Start the app by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. **View in Browser:**
   Your app will automatically open in your default web browser. You should see the output of the `Greeting` component, along with the CSS styles applied.

**Summary:**

In this lab, you learned how to create a React component that accepts props and console.logs() the properties. You gained an understanding that props are passed as an object. You also used JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces. Additionally, you explored applying CSS styles to your component to enhance its visual appearance.
