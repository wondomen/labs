# Labs: 



For each lab:

- use degit
- note the use of [npx] NOT npm, we will discuus it later but in brief:  
> `npm` and `npx` are related to package management in Node.js, `npm` is used to install and manage packages, while `npx` is used to run commands from packages without the need to install them globally or locally.
- file hierarchy: Submission structure
- no space in between
- Web-dev/week1 etc
