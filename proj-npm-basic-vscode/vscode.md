# Lab: Introduction to Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

### Objective: 

In this lab, you will be introduced to Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a popular and versatile code editor. You will learn how to navigate the interface, perform basic code editing tasks, and use some essential features that make VSCode a powerful tool for developers.

### Prerequisites:

A computer with Visual Studio Code installed (You can download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/).


### Steps 

- Step 1: Opening VSCode
Open Visual Studio Code from your applications or start menu.
- Step 2: Exploring the Interface

  - Activity Bar: Along the bottom, you have the activity bar with icons for various panels like Terminal, Problems, Output, and Extensions.
  - Editor Area: The main area is the editor, where you'll write your code.

- Step 3: Creating a New File
  - Click on the "Explorer" icon in the sidebar.
  - Click on the "New File" button (icon with a document and a plus sign).
  - Name the file "hello_world.js" (without quotes).
- Step 4: Writing Code
In the newly created file, type the following code:
```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

- Step 5: Saving the File
  - Go to the "File" menu and choose "Save" or press Ctrl + S (Cmd + S on macOS).
  - Notice that the file appears in the Explorer sidebar.
- Step 6: Running the Code
  - Open the integrated terminal in VSCode:
  - Go to the "View" menu and select "Terminal" or press Ctrl + ` (backtick).
  - In the terminal, make sure you are in the correct directory by using the cd command.
  - Run the JavaScript file using the command:
```sh

Step 7: Extensions
  - Go to the Extensions sidebar (icon with four squares).
  - Search for the "Bracket Pair Colorizer" extension and install it.
  - Reload VSCode to activate the extension.
  - Open a new JavaScript file and notice how the extension colorizes matching brackets for better code readability.
- Step 8: Using Shortcuts
  - Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Cmd + Shift + P on macOS) to open the command palette.
  - Type "format document" and select the option to format your code automatically.
- Step 9: Customizing Settings
  - Go to "File" > "Preferences" > "Settings".
  - Explore various settings that you can customize to tailor VSCode to your preferences.
- Step 10: Wrapping Up

### Recap

You've successfully completed the introduction to Visual Studio Code. This versatile code editor offers numerous features that will enhance your coding experience. Experiment with different extensions, keyboard shortcuts, and settings to make VSCode work best for you.
